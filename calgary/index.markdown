### About OpenHack

OpenHack is a meetup with a simple purpose: Coders getting together and coding.

#### The Basics

* You can hack on anything! Any language, framework, public/open-source, personal, etc.
* You don't have to have an idea to hack on! You're more than welcome to come just to pair with someone.
* Starts off with a quick round of introductions **(every night!)**, to say who you are, what you're working on, and if you'd like help with your idea.
