### Info

HackNights are for people willing to hack on anything, at any skill level. You can come to practice a new programming language or use some new library/framework, work on your open-source or personal projects. You might just come to pair with someone else or to share some thoughts. Whatever you find interesting.

Beers, snacks, pizza and foosball will be here for you.

Meetings are held at [Peertransfer Valencia](http://goo.gl/maps/XkGHD) every last thursday of the month at 7pm.
