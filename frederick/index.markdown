## Info

We just started the [http://twitter.com/search?q=%23FrederickMD](#FrederickMD) OpenHack when we saw the OpenHack project. As such we're still pretty early in the process, but we want to meet when you do! Just ping us at our other locations to coordinate what works best for your schedule.

## Local Technology Meetups

### Frederick Web Tech

A monthly web technology meetup (with regular drinkups as well). Find out about meetup events at [http://meetup.com/FredWebTech](http://meetup.com/FredWebTech).

### Frederick Riding Rails

An online organized meetup at [http://frederickridingrails.org](http://frederickridingrails.org) currently, but we'd love to meet around town to pair, hack on open source and give back to our community! Just drop by the group to express interest and others will join in!
