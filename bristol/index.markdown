## Bristol, UK

![Bristol Hack Night!](/bristol/logo.png)

### Info

Everyone welcome, we tend to work on a lot of web stuff from visual design through to coding - although there is sometimes a bit of embedded programming thrown in too. Doesn't matter what you're experience level is - the more the merrier.

Evenings can vary from working on a group project, pair programming, and checking out what other people are working on or just chatting - it's up to you.

We try and run every week so people can drop in and keep working on things. You can see what we've been playing with up on [Github](https://github.com/bristol-hacknight/)

Things tend to be practical, so bring your laptop, what ever ideas you've got and your favorite food / drink to share.

### When

Runs most weeks on Wednesday, starting at 7pm.

### Where

Jiva Technology, Third Floor, St Thomas Court, Thomas Lane, Bristol, BS1 6JG
