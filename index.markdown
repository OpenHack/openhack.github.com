## Code Together.

OpenHack is a meetup with a simple purpose: Code together, on anything. OpenHack works by hosting a meetup in your city that gets programmers of any experience level together to code.

### What is OpenHack?

### How does OpenHack work?

* You can hack on anything! Any language, framework, public/open-source, personal, etc.
* You don't have to have an idea to hack on! You're more than welcome to come just to pair with someone.
* Start off with a quick round of introductions **(every night!)**, to say who you are, what you're working on, and if you'd like help with your idea.
* Provide food and some coffee/drinks for attendees. Sponsors will help immensely with funding this.
* Someone has to host the meetup. That person is in charge of ordering food and starting off the intro.
* Don't go too late. 9-10pm is good. Focus usually wanes by this point, for obvious reasons! Maybe if there's interest head to a bar for more discussion.

These are simply guidelines for running an OpenHack, and they're meant to be [forked](https://github.com/openhack/openhack.github.com). Existing meetups/hack nights (mornings too!) **are encouraged** to fly under the OpenHack banner! Multiple meetups in a city based on time or location are welcome also.
