This is where we'll post new updates to this page on new meeting dates.

### FORMAT

Weâ€™re going to have a little structure around our first meeting (but not too much) to see how it goes. The idea is to use some structure to grease the wheels a little bit and get things rolling.

* Meet at location
* Introductions (stand-up style)
* Hack
* Present work, if you want to
* Go out to eat or drink afterwards

### Next meetups

* [First meetup](#) - Information coming soon
