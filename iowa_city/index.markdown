OpenHack Iowa City meets roughly **once a month** to code together, and hang out with like minded techies. The event is open to programmers of all skill levels and from any programming community.

If you have any questions, please contact [@OpenHackIC](http://twitter.com/OpenHackIC) or [@benjaminoakes](http://twitter.com/benjaminoakes).

### Next meetup
