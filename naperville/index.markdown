## Naperville, IL

OpenHack Naperville meets at [Grid Connect](http://www.gridconnect.com/), which is located here:

1630 W. Diehl Road
Naperville, IL 60563

We're a small group of tech enthusiasts from a variety of backgrounds; Ruby, Swift, Node, PHP, whatever. It doesn't matter what you code on or your skill level, we'd love to have you come out and hack with us!

We start at 6:30 and hack until about 9:30. It's BYOB and beer is definitely encouraged! Check our [Meetup page](http://www.meetup.com/OpenHack-Naperville/) for our next meeting.

Pizza from Lou Malnati's is generously provided by our hosts, [Grid Connect](http://www.gridconnect.com).
