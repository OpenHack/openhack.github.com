## Houghton, MI

![First Hackfest](/houghton/img/hackfest1.jpg)

### Info

We host our own open hackfests about every two weeks in the [ITOxygen](http://www.itoxygen.com) lab right here on campus at [Michigan Technological University](http://mtu.edu). We usually try to provide food and beverages, but we won't make any guarantees :)

### Our Meetups

We usually try to keep things focused on code, but sometimes spontaneous music, juggling, or other shenanigans break loose. We love teaching people new things, and are always looking for something new to jump into ourselves. Come hack with us!
