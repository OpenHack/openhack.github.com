### Info

OpenHack Bellingham is organized by members of the Bellingham Rubyists and the Bellingham Linux Users Group.  We are a language-agnostic group and welcome all skill levels.  Come to get help on a problem, mentor a junior dev, or just hack!

### Meetings

Meetings are held on the 4th Thursday of every month, from 6pm to around 9pm.  Come late and/or leave early as your schedule requires.  We start with brief round of introductions: who you are, what you're working on, what you need help with, etc.  Then we start hacking: you can pair up with somebody or work solo - itâ€™s up to you.  Follow our mailing list or Twitter feed to get more info on upcoming meetings.

### Location

The September meeting will take place at the AVA.ai office at [1201 Cornwall Avenue, Suite 201](http://goo.gl/maps/i9VIo).

<!--
Unless otherwise announced, we meet at the Attachmate office at [2925 Roeder Ave, Suite #300](http://goo.gl/maps/r6y0Y) overlooking beautiful Bellingham Bay. On nice summer evenings we may even hang out on the roof to catch every last minute of sunshine.
