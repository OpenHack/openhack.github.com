## Boston

![boston](/boston/boston.jpg)

OpenHack Boston meets at [DockYard](http://dockyard.com), located at 101
Tremont Street (2nd floor), Boston, MA 02108.

Follow [@BostonOpenHack](https://twitter.com/BostonOpenHack) for future
updates.

Here's how OpenHack will work:

* You can hack on anything! Doesn't matter the language, framework, if it's
  public/open-source, personal, etc.
* You don't need to come with an idea to hack on! You're more than welcome to
  come just to pair with someone.
* We'll start off with a quick round of introductions (every night!), to say who
  you are, what you're working on, and if you'd like help with an idea.
* The organizers will order food, so you don't have to worry about dinner.
  We greatly appreciate sponsors for this, and please do get in contact if
  you are interested.
* BYOB is very encouraged!
* We'll call it a night around 10pm or 11pm. Focus usually wanes by this point, for
  obvious reasons! If there's interest for further discussion, we can head to a
  bar.

Please RSVP so we know how much food to get!
