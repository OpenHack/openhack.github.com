## Green Bay

### Info

8 of us or so get together weekly from noon to 2pm on Thursdays at the only "official" co-working space in Green Bay (that I know of), [The Docking Station](http://www.thedockingstation.net/). 3-6 of us are there all day, every Thursday, to co-work & hack together on our own separate projects while leaning on others for questions/support.

Languages/technologies currently covered: 

* Ruby
* Python
* JavaScript/jQuery/Coffeescript
* SASS/LESS
* Git
* and other related web application dev technologies

If there is enough interest we could move/extend/continue the time to accommodate more people.

### Next meetups

We currently meet every Thursday (RSVP to [the Meetup Group](http://greenbayrug.com) if you'd be so kind!). The official meetup group is of the Ruby persuasion, but we invite any/all coders that want to hack to join us.

### Past meetups

Here's a pic from our very first meetup with just two of us :) Chris in the photo and Jon taking it.
