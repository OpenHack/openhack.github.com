### Info

You can hack on anything you want. Open source, closed source. Work. Play. Any skill level on anything on any project, it’s all good as long as you’re here to sling code.

As it very new, we're open to any idea, suggestion, requests, sponsoring offers to make this thing as regular and fun as possible. We're
planning on a meetup per month.
