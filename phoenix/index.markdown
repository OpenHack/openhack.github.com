### About OpenHack PHX

We have a thriving developer community in Phoenix, but far too few opportunities to hang out with other developers and sling some code. So of course OpenHack's motto, *Code together, on anything*, got us interesed, and OpenHack PHX was born.

- You can hack on anything! Any language, framework, public/open-source, personal/closed source... *anything*
- You donâ€™t have to have an idea, you can join someone else.
- We'll kick the event off with a quick round of introductions.
- Provided there's a sponsor, food and drinks will be provided, but you're welcome to bring your own.
- We'll generally wrap things up around 9pm or move to a nearby restaurant, coffee shop or bar.

### Support

Interested in getting involved and helping out the community? We're always looking for the following:
