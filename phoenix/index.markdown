### About OpenHackPHX

We have a thriving developer community in Phoenix, but far too few opportunities to hang out with other developers and sling some code. So of course OpenHack's motto, *Code together, on anything*, got me interesed, and OpenHackPHX was born.

The rules are simple:

- You can hack on anything! Any language, framework, public/open-source, personal/closed source... *anything*
- You donâ€™t have to have an idea, you can join someone else.
- We'll kick the event off with a quick round of introductions.
- If there's a sponsor for food and drinks, it will be noted, but you're welcome to bring your own.
- We'll generally wrap things up around 9pm or move to a nearby restaurant, coffee shop or bar.

### Support

Interested in getting involved and helping out the community? We're always looking for the following:

- People to spread the word (retweets and meetup cross-posts welcome)
- Space to host OpenHack
- Sponsors to cover the food and drinks

If you're interested in helping out, come by one of our events, or send a  message via [Twitter](https://twitter.com/OpenHackPHX) or [email](mailto:openhackphx@gmail.com).
