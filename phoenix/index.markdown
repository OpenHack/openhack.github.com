### Upcoming OpenHacks

- **Thur, June 20th, 6:30pm** - The Inaugural OpenHack PHX at [HeatSync Labs](http://goo.gl/niN2A) in Mesa

### About OpenHack PHX

We have a thriving developer community in Phoenix, but far too few opportunities to hang out with other developers and sling some code. So of course OpenHack's motto, *Code together, on anything*, got us interesed, and OpenHack PHX was born.

- You can hack on anything! Any language, framework, public/open-source, personal/closed source... *anything*
- You donâ€™t have to have an idea. Come just to pair with someone, or find someone else without an idea and create something together.
- We'll kick the event off with a quick round of introductions. Say who you are, what you're working on, if you want to pair, if you need help with anything, etc.
- Food and drinks will be provided, but you're welcome to bring your own.
- We'll generally wrap things up around 9pm or move to a nearby restaurant, coffee shop or bar.
