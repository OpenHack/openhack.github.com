### OpenHack Meetup Group

While we're not as active as we once were, OpenHackATX does still exist! It turns out that
using Meetup.com works out better for us; far more people hear about us this way than
would otherwise happen.

Check us out over at Meetup:

### Other, similar options

If you're looking for other options (maybe certain days don't work for you),
there's [Cafe Bedouins](http://cafebedouins.com/).
They generally meet every Tuesday at a coffee shop or other similar location at 7PM.

#### Looking to get in touch?

Your best bet is to contact the organizer(s) of OpenHackATX via the aforementioned
meetup.com link. Leadership of these community organizations does change hands over
time - by necessity (running something like this can be a _huge_ undetaking!) - so
the most up-to-date information on who's who, what's what and when's when is going
to be there.

##### Who maintains this specific page?

That would be yours truly, [J. Austin Hughey](https://github.com/jaustinhughey).
I was the original organizer, and stepped down after a couple years, letting more
passionate folks step in and do things their own way. Contact me via GitHub if
you believe this page needs to be updated in some way.
