## Baltimore

### Info

Bmore on Rails hosts Open Source Hack Night (OSHN) on the fourth Tuesday of every month at the [Beehive](http://beehivebaltimore.org) co-working space. We are language-agnostic, but attendees are often Ruby-focused.

RSVP on [Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/bmore-on-rails/) and let us know what you'd like to work on. Pizza is provided by a sponsor, BYOB.

### History

Since 2006, [Bmore on Rails](http://bmoreonrails.org) has been running monthly meetups in Baltimore city. In 2010, we added two more monthly meetings to our schedule. The first is OSHN, an opportunity for developers to get together and hack on projects together. It has evolved into a great opportunity for folks new to Ruby to get some expert one-on-once advice on how to get started doing Ruby and Rails development. The second is Pub Night, which has a strict no-laptops policy. We enjoy fine cocktails together in Fells Point.
