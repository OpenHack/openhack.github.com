### Location

Come hang out and hack with us!

We meet every Tuesday night at 6pm at the restaurant in [Peacock Billiards](http://www.peacockbilliards.com/) (James Joyce Bistro) at [1175 Douglas St](https://maps.google.ca/maps?client=ubuntu&channel=fs&oe=utf-8&q=1280+Broad+St&ie=UTF8&hq=&hnear=1280+Broad+St,+Victoria,+British+Columbia+V8W+2A4&gl=ca&t=m&z=16&vpsrc=://maps.google.ca/maps?ie=UTF-8&q=peacocks+victoria&fb=1&gl=ca&hq=peacocks+victoria&cid=0,0,8681642815041155577&ei=V6XuUamgC4ybigKlxICwBQ&ved=0CDUQrwswAA). We do introductions at 6:15pm.

After introductions, hack on whatever you want! This is what OpenHack is all about. You can try to find someone to pair up with or work alone–it’s totally up to you. Hack on anything: open-source, closed-source, work, play. All experience levels and technologies are welcome. Just don’t forget to bring a computer!

Understand that this is an indoor event where we'll be seated at a table together and masks are not required (since people will be eating and drinking.) If you are experiencing any COVID-19 symptoms, do not attend.

We understand that some people might not yet be comfortable attending an indoor meetup. We respect that and hope you'll join when you feel ready.

Don't forget to bring a laptop!
