### Info

We meet every Tuesday night from 6-8pm at [Serious Coffee](http://www.seriouscoffee.com/locations/victoria/broad-street) at [1280 Broad St](https://maps.google.ca/maps?client=ubuntu&channel=fs&oe=utf-8&q=1280+Broad+St&ie=UTF8&hq=&hnear=1280+Broad+St,+Victoria,+British+Columbia+V8W+2A4&gl=ca&t=m&z=16&vpsrc=0) 

You can hack on anything! 
* Any language, framework, public/open-source, personal, other.
* You don’t have to have an idea to hack on! You’re more than welcome to come just to pair with someone.
* We always start off with a quick round of introductions, to say who you are, what you’re working on, and if you’d like help with your idea.

This is what OpenHack is all about - slingin’ code. 
For 2 hours you can pair up with somebody or work totally alone - it’s totally up to you.

* First OpenHack will be Tuesday June 18, 2013
