## Sydney, Australia

### Info

We run a monthly Hack Night where we hang out and code together. The event is open to programmers of all skill levels and from any programming community.

Although the idea for Hack Night sprang out of RORO Sydney meetups a couple of years ago, we work on a wide variety of technologies (Javascript, Big Data, NoSQL, etc).

We especially encourage beginners and to come and learn in a fun and supportive environment.
