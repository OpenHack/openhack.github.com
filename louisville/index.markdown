### The OpenHack Format

We have a *little* structure around our meetings to give people a chance to
speak, bounce ideas off others, and "break the ice" for anyone who hasn't met
before.  We are loosely adopting a structure that has worked well for other
OpenHack meetups.

- 6:00 - Meet and Greet, Please share who you are, and what interests you.
- 6:15 - Hack.
- 9:00 - Wrap-up.

We'll begin with introductions around 6. Just say who you are, what you do and
where you do it (if you want to), what languages/frameworks you work with, and
anything else you want to share. This is just to let everybody get to know each
other and see who does what so others can help/pair with them, or ask for help
if you know something they don't.

Next is the hack session. This is what OpenHack is all about - slingin' code.
That's 2 and a half hours. You can pair up with somebody or work totally alone -
it's totally up to you. We encourage you to pair just for the fun of it, but
nobody's going to even -remotely- have a problem if you don't.

You can hack on anything you want. Open source, closed source. Work. Play.  Any
skill level on anything on any project, it's all good as long as you're here to
sling code.

Finally, we'll wrap up with a segment that, for lack of a better term, we'll
call "bring it to the tribe". The idea is that as a community of developers,
engineers and computer scientists, we're a "tribe" of sorts. So we need to help
each other out.  OpenHack - for us anyway - isn't just about the code, but also
about *the people who write it*! So we want to leverage the collective widsom
of our "tribe" to help each other. This small wrap-up is designed to give
people a chance to present a problem they may be having (code related) to the
group.

Things like, "I can't seem to grasp rspec's DSL, can anybody recommend a
good book or resource", or "does anyone have any tips on how to convince my
boss to let me re-implement this crufty old system written in outdated perl
scripts as a REST-based SOA since it would be just so much cleaner?". These
topics (and more!) are what the tribe session is meant for, and we want to
provide an open, official forum for members to ask each other for help in their
present challenge. Maybe some one has experience, a book, or a contact who can
help you out. This gives each of us a chance to leverage the group's "tribal
knowledge" to solve a problem.

### We want feedback

OpenHack is about the developer community. This group exists to give you a
repeated and predictable opportunity to get out and among your peers, hack on a
project, develop connections with people, and have fun while being productive.
We would love to hear your ideas on how together we can further that goal,
please tweet the organizers

### Past meetups
We've been meeting every month since December 2012, with a short hiatus in 2017.  Attendance averages around 10-12
people with a couple outliers at 4 and 22.
