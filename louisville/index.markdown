### Info

Planning on meeting at [iHub](http://nucleusky.com/ihub) (204 South Floyd Street, Louisville, KY 40202) on the second Tuesday of each month. More meetings may be planned as attendance dictates.

The first meeting is NOT on the second Tuesday of December however, due to a scheduling conflict at the facility.

* You can hack on anything! Any language, framework, public/open-source, personal, etc.
* Skill level doesn't matter. We don't care if you're working on Hello World or on increasing your wizarding level.
* You don’t have to have an idea to hack on! You’re more than welcome to come just to pair with someone.
