### Info

Planning on meeting at [iHub](http://nucleusky.com/ihub) (204 South Floyd Street, Louisville, KY 40202) on the first Tuesday of each month. Weekend meetings may be planned as attendance dictates.

* You can hack on anything! Any language, framework, public/open-source, personal, etc.
* Skill level doesn't matter. We don't care if you're working on Hello World or on increasing your wizarding level.
* You don’t have to have an idea to hack on! You’re more than welcome to come just to pair with someone.
