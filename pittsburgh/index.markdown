## Pittsburgh

### Open. Hack. Night. Pittsburgh.

![January 2013 OpenHackPGH](/pittsburgh/images/2013-01/general-talking.jpg)

Jointly presented by [PGHPython](http://pghpython.org/) and [pghrb](http://pghrb.org)
OpenHack Pittsburgh is held on the fourth Monday of every even month, from 6:30-9:00pm.

- *Open* - OpenHack is open to anyone, regardless of technology or skill
- *Hack* - The only goal is to create something together and have fun doing it
- *Night* - Meetings are timeboxed to create a sense of purpose and a reason to follow up at the bar after ;)
- *Pittsburgh* - We believe the technology community in this city is a sleeping giant dying for this
