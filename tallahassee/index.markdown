### Info
OpenHack Tallahassee: Code together, on anything, in Tally! [Sign Up Here](http://cuttlesoft.us2.list-manage1.com/subscribe?u=0a9c4e6d98c40fc427b9fcf80&id=9edcb2c6c8)

We're a group of developers, tinkerers, programmers, designers, students, professionals....and more. Tallahassee has a young, intelligent and vibrant culture.
Our meetups should be about seeing what comes out of that culture when a bunch of local hackers get together.

Everyone is welcome. All ages and experience levels.

OpenHackTLH is coordinated by me :-) [Frank](http://about.me/frankv) <br />
