### Info
OpenHack Tallahassee: Code together, on anything, in Tally!

We're a group of developers, tinkerers, programmers, designers, students, professionals....and more. Tallahassee has a young, intelligent and vibrant culture.
Our meetups should be about seeing what comes out of that culture when a bunch of local hackers get together.

Everyone is welcome. All ages and experience levels.
